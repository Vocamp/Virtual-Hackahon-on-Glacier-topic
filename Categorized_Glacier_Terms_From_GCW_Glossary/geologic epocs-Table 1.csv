Term,Source,Category,Definition,
Deglaciation,AMS,Glaciers,The removal of land ice from an area; the opposite of glacierization.,
epoch,AMS,Glaciers,"1.Any of the geologic epochs characterized by an ice age.  Thus, the Pleistocene epoch may be termed a ""glacial epoch.""  2.Generally, an interval of geologic time that was marked by a major equatorward advance of ice.  This has been applied to an entire ice age or (rarely) to the individual glacial ""stages"" that make up an ice age. The term ""epoch"" here is not used in the most technical sense of a geologic epoch.",
Glacial interstade,WMO METEOTERM,Glaciers,An interval (literally a stage) of time characterized by an equatorward spread of ice (of shorter duration than a glacial epoch).,
Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA),IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A change of glacier surface elevation due to vertical motion of the glacier bed under the influence of mass redistribution in the underlying solid Earth. Present-day mass redistribution in the Earth's interior is dominated by continuing adjustment to the redistribution of surface water at the end of the most recent ice age. Corrections are also required for vertical motions of tectonic origin in some regions, such as the Karakoram.",
Glacial maximum,AMS,Glaciers,The time of greatest ice volume and/or position of greatest areal extent of any glacierization.,
Glacial period,AMS,Glaciers,"1.Any of the geologic periods that embraced an ice age.  For example, the Quaternary period may be called a ""glacial period.""  2.Generally, an interval of geologic time that was marked by a major equatorward advance of ice.  This may be applied to an entire ice age or (rarely) to the individual glacier ""stages"" that make up an ice age. The term ""period"" here is not used in the most technical sense of a geologic period.",
Glacial phase,WMO METEOTERM,Glaciers,"Period, during an ice age, marked by a major equatorward advance of ice.",
Glacial-interglacial cycles,IPCC WGI AR5 2013,Glaciers,Phase of the Earth's history marked by large changes in continental ice volume and global sea level. See also Ice age and Interglacials.,
Glaciated,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,Land covered in the past by any form of glacier is said to be glaciated.,
Glaciation,AMS,Glaciers,"1.Alteration of any part of the earth's surface by passage of a glacier, chiefly by glacial erosion or deposition; distinguish from glacierization.  2.As used in many texts, particularly with respect to the ice ages, same as glacierization, for example, ""Pleistocene glaciation.""  3.The transformation of cloud particles from supercooled water drops to ice crystals. Thus, a cumulonimbus cloud is said to have a glaciated upper portion.",
Glaciation level,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"In any small glacierized region, the average of the elevations of the highest unglacierized peak and the lowest glacierized peak. The glaciation level has been used as a regional-scale proxy for the steady-state ELA, although a correction is required for this purpose because the glaciation level is known to be systematically higher by about 200 m. See mid-range altitude.",
Glaciation limit,AMS,Glaciers,"1.For a given locality, the lowest altitude at which glaciers can develop.  2.Same as glacial maximum.",
Glacierization,AMS,Glaciers,"The covering of a land area by glacier ice.  This term was coined by G. Taylor in the Antarctic and introduced by Wright and Priestly (1922) to distinguish the act of glacial inundation from its geologic consequences (glaciation). It is growing in use in Great Britain but still is considered unnecessary by some American geologists, who use ""glacier covering.""",
Ice age,AMS,Ice Sheets and shelves,"A major interval of geologic time during which extensive ice sheets (continental glaciers) formed over many parts of the world.  The best known ice ages are 1) the Huronian in Canada, occurring very early in the Proterozoic era (2700-1800 million years ago); 2) the pre-Cambrian and early Cambrian, which occurred in the early Paleozoic era (about 540 million years ago) and left traces widely scattered over the world; and 3) the Permo-Carboniferous, occurring during the late Paleozoic era (from 290 million years ago), which was extensively developed on Gondwana, a large continent comprising what is now India, South America, Australia, Antarctica, Africa, and portions of Asia and North America. The term ice age is also applied to advances and retreats of glaciers during the Quaternary era.",
Interglacial,AMS,Glaciers,"A period of warm climate during the Pleistocene (and earlier glacial epochs) during which continental glaciers retreated to minimum extent.  Interglacials have been of approximately 10 000 years duration, spaced at approximately 100 000-year intervals over the last 1 000 000 years. The last 10 000 years, or postglacial, is generally considered to be an interglacial.",
Interglacial phase,AMS,Glaciers,"Generally, an interval of geologic time that was marked by a major poleward retreat of ice.  This may be applied to an entire interval between ice ages or (rarely) to the individual ""stages"" that make up an interglacial period.",
Interglacials or interglaciations,IPCC WGI AR5 2013,Glaciers,"The warm periods between ice age glaciations. Often defined as the periods at which sea levels were close to present sea level. For the Last Interglacial (LIG) this occurred between about 129 and 116 ka (thousand years) before present (defined as 1950) although the warm period started in some areas a few thousand years earlier. In terms of the oxygen isotope record interglaciations are defined as the interval between the midpoint of the preceding termination and the onset of the next glaciation. The present interglaciation, the Holocene, started at 11.65 ka before present although globally sea levels did not approach their present position until about 7 ka before present.",
Isostasy,2-Molnia,Glaciers,"The balance between changes within the Earth's crust and mantle, where material is displaced in response to an increase (isostatic depression) or decrease (isostatic rebound) in mass at any point on the Earth's surface above. Such changes are frequently caused by advances or retreats of glaciers.",
Isostatic adjustment,AMS,Ice Sheets and shelves,"The movement of the solid part of the earth until it is in balance;  also called isostatic compensation.  The prime example of isostatic adjustment is the continents ""floating"" on the denser parts of the crust.",
Isostatic depression,PhysicalGeography.net,Ice Sheets and shelves,Large scale sinking of the crust into the asthenosphere because of an increase in weight on the crustal surface. Common in areas of continental glaciation where the crust was depressed by the weight of the ice.,
Isostatic rebound,PhysicalGeography.net,Ice Sheets and shelves,The upward movement of the Earth's crust following isostatic depression.,
Last Glacial Maximum (LGM),IPCC WGII AR5 2014,Ice Sheets and shelves,"The period during the last ice age when the glaciers and ice sheets reached their maximum extent, approximately 21 ka ago. This period has been widely studied because the radiative forcings and boundary conditions are relatively well known.",
Last interglacial,AMS,Ice Sheets and shelves,"The most recent time (115 000 to 125 000 years ago) during which global temperatures were as high as or higher than in the postglacial, when continental glaciers were limited to the Arctic and Antarctic, and sea levels were near current positions.",
Little ice age,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,"A period of cooling that occurred from the 16th through the early 19th century, and was marked by expanding glaciers in Europe, North America, and Asia",
Neoglacial,AMS,Glaciers,A period of general expansion of glaciers variously defined as spanning from approximately 3000 to 2000 years ago or covering the last 4000-5000 years.,
Neoglaciation,2-Molnia,Glaciers,"Neoglaciation refers to the advances made by mountain glaciers since the great Pleistocene ice age. In the Cascades the advances have occurred since 6,600 years before present.",
Pleistocene,2-Molnia,Glaciers,"The epoch of geologic time, informally called the 'The Great Ice Age' or the 'Glacial Epoch', that began ~1.8 million years ago and ended ~8,000 years ago (see the CVO's Geologic Time Scale). During this interval continental glaciers repeatedly formed and covered significant parts of the Earth's surface. Together, the Holocene and Pleistocene epochs comprise the Quaternary Period.",
Pleistocene glaciation,AMS,Atmosphere,The periodic expansion of continental ice sheets to cover much of Canada and northeastern Asia during the interval 2 500 000-10 000 years ago.,
rebound,AMS,Glaciers,Vertical raising of a portion of the earth's crust following the removal of an ice mass.  Glacial rebound is the reaction to deglaciation.,
uplift,PhysicalGeography.net,Glaciers,Upward movement of the Earth's crust following isostatic depression from the weight of the continental glaciers.  ,
Younger Dryas,AMS,Misc,"The period from approximately 10 800 to 9600 BC when climate in the region around Greenland cooled by 5-7C within a few decades and recovered with similar rapidity at the end of the period; named for the expansion of the geographic range of the arctic herb Dryas octopetala.  Evidence is accumulating for a wider, perhaps global, extent, but the Younger Dryas was most strongly felt around the North Atlantic Ocean. Changes in the thermohaline circulation of the oceans are widely believed to be implicated in the onset and ending of the Younger Dryas cooling. These were in turn associated with a switch to the St. Lawrence River as the major route for meltwater reaching the North Atlantic from the retreating continental ice cap. Other similarly rapid oscillations in climate are recorded through much of the last glacial in ice cores from Greenland and in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic (Dansgaard-Oeschger events). The period since the Younger Dryas (the Holocene) lacks such extreme excursions.",
