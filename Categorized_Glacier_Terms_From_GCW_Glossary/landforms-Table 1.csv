"moraine, Terminal ",2-Molnia,Glaciers,"Terminal moraines are piles of loose unconsolidated rock at the glacier's downvalley end. The rocks may be pushed there by the forward motion of the glacier or dumped from the glacier's rounded surface. As glaciers melt, their remaining load of rocks is distributed in several ways. Rocks may be dropped in place by the melting ice; they may be rolled to the ice margins, or they may be deposited by meltwater streams. Collectively, these deposits are called 'glacial drift'. 'Till' refers to the debris deposited directly by the glacier. Rock debris rolls off the glacier edges and builds piles of loose unconsolidated rocks called 'glacier moraine'.

Periglacial climate,AMS,Atmosphere,The climate characteristic of the regions immediately bordering the outer perimeter of an ice cap or continental glacier.  The principal climatic feature is the high frequency of very cold and dry winds off the ice area. These regions have been thought to create ideal conditions for the maintenance of a belt of intense cyclonic activity.,
Periglacial environment - Andean definition,Trombotto et al. 2014,Glaciers,"The environment, which is cold and cryogenic, but not Glaciated, above of the tree line if existent. There is no clear physical limit to the glacial environment and its boundary is diffuse. However, the limit to the non-Periglacial Environment is clearly marked by the following indicators: occurrence of Permafrost in depth, including permanently frozen soil and possibly presence of Ground Ice preserved under natural conditions for long periods of time. This constitutes the decisive element whereby an environment is called Periglacial or cryogenic environment dominated by cycles of freezing and thawing affecting rocks and the top of the soil; and presence of Solifluction / Gelifluction and other cryogenic processes (Frost Weathering, sorting, Cryoturbation, etc.) that lead to the so-called Periglacial geomorphology, such as the formation of small scale sorted ground or Rock Glaciers on a mesoscale. For some authors of the northern hemisphere the presence of Permafrost is not a prerequisite for the Periglacial Environment, however, it is for the cryo-scientists working in the Andes.",
Periglacial environment - Northern Hemisphere definition,Trombotto et al. 2014,Glaciers,"The Periglacial Environment is defined as those areas in which Frost Action and / or Permafrost related processes dominate. Note: In the early definition of the Periglacial Environment two criteria were regarded as diagnostic of the Periglacial Environment: i) there is ground freezing and thawing, and ii) presence of perennially Frozen Ground. Today, Permafrost is considered to not being the only diagnostic criterion because Permafrost is a thermal concept, whereas Periglacial is a geomorphological definition that is concerned with landforms and processes that are not controlled by temperature alone.",

Protalus rampart,Trombotto et al. 2014,Glaciers,"A Protalus Rampart is a ridge or ramp of debris that develops along the lower margin of a perennial Snow Patch. Early studies assumed that they were formed simply through the Accumulation of rock fall debris. Two views on the origin of Protalus Rampart compete. The first suggests that they are part of a linear developmental continuum of Rock Glaciers, thus thought to be due to Permafrost Creep. The second view suggests that Protalus Ramparts are not part of a developmental continuum of Rock Glaciers. Although very common in the central Andes, there are few studies devoted to these landforms (Trombotto, 2000). Note: This type of landform, when larger than 0.01 km2 and showing downslope movements, it could already be considered as a Rock Glacier.",
Quartz microtexture of the periglacial environment,Trombotto et al. 2014,Misc,"Micro textural characteristics of the quartz grains (sand size) that exist in sediments found in the Periglacial Environment. Their characteristics are related to cryogenic processes like frost weathering, sorting, cryoturbation and friction intergranular movements due to freezing and thawing cycles in sedimentary deposits. The main characteristics are: grains with a high degree of roughness, angular, conchoidal fractures, chatter marks, straight and curved lines, and graduated arches. There are also micro phenomena in terms of deposition and dilution.",
