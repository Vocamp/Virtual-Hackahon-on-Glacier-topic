Ablatometer,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A device installed at the glacier surface for the measurement, during the ablation season, of changes in elevation of the glacier surface relative to a fixed elevation, such as that of the top of a mass-balance stake embedded in the ice beneath the surface. A star ablatometer is an array of rigid metal arms that can be attached to a stake and levelled. A graduated rod is lowered through holes in the arms to measure changes in the surface elevation, yielding a considerably larger sample than that obtained from readings of the stake alone. Sometimes an ablatometer is actually a sonic ranger.",

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR),IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A radar, usually a pulsed system with one transmitting and one receiving antenna, operating at a frequency suitable for imaging the subsurface. In glaciology, low frequencies (2220 mhz) are suitable for ice thickness measurements whereas higher frequencies of several hundred mhz are suitable for snow thickness measurements, including detection of the current summer surface and older Annual layering (see radar method). Higher frequencies yield better resolution but may not allow very deep penetration; lower frequencies exhibit the reverse properties. Choice of frequency is therefore paramount. Radar imaging of the subsurface relies on accurate determination of the two-way travel time of the radar wave, which depends on the density. Reflections are caused by contrasts in the (complex) relative dielectric constant at interfaces between layers. Illustrative values of the real part of the relative dielectric constant, at frequencies used by ground-penetrating radars, are 1 for air, ~3.15 for pure ice, ~10 for bedrock and 88 for water at 0 ",

Interferometry,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Measurement of the interference of waves, particularly electromagnetic waves, from a common source such as a radar, with the aim of obtaining information about the topography, velocity field and other characteristics of the glacier surface. See insar.",
Laser altimeter,IACS-UNESCO,Permafrost,"An instrument for altimetry, and in mass-balance studies for the measurement of elevation change by repeated altimetry, that uses pulses of laser radiation, for example at 532 nm (green) or 1024 nm (near infrared) wavelengths. There are both profiling and scanning laser altimeters. A profiling system is nadir-pointing, while a scanning system uses a rotating mirror, or a series of sensors arrayed in a parallel (push broom) configuration, to obtain a swath rather than a linear profile of measurements. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (icesat, 20032010) measured surface elevations with approximately 70 m footprint and 170 m along-track spacing. Adjacent tracks are separated by a few to a few tens of kilometres, the lesser separations being found at the polar extremities of the orbit. Sources of error include sensor saturation, atmospheric scattering effects, and inaccurate knowledge of the laser pointing angles. Aircraft altimeters have footprints of 1 m or smaller and along-track spacing on the order of 1 to 3 m, and are less affected by atmospheric and pointing errors. Laser altimeters are unable to obtain measurements through clouds. Laser is an acronym standing for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. A related term, lidar (light detection and ranging), applies more generally to the measurement of scattered light from distant targets.",

Microwave remote sensing,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Remote sensing with an Active-microwave sensor or a passive-microwave sensor. At frequencies between about 1 ghz and 40 ghz, microwaves are capable of penetrating clouds, and orbiting sensors can measure surface properties in all atmospheric conditions. Corrections must be made for scattering resulting from atmospheric and ionospheric variations. At frequencies below a few ghz, the depth of penetration beneath the glacier surface becomes great enough to permit Active-microwave imaging or profiling of the subsurface from the surface or from aircraft. The terms microwave and radar are often used interchangeably. This is mainly because the boundary between the lower-frequency radio and higher-frequency microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum is fixed differently, between 0.3 and 300 ghz (wavelengths of 1 m to 1 mm), by different authorities.",
Radar altimeter,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"An instrument for altimetry that transmits and receives pulses of microwave radiation. Satellite radar altimeters (including ERS-1 and 2, Envisat and others) typically operate in the Ku band (13.5 ghz; 22 mm wavelength) and were designed primarily for oceanographic monitoring. Because of their relatively large footprint (several km), they are best suited for measuring elevationsof gently-sloping regions of the ice sheets. Steep or undulating terrain produces complex waveforms and difficulties in achieving accurate estimates of range (i. E. Distance). Surface and volume scattering also affect the radar pulse and create uncertainty in the effective depth of the reflecting horizon. Surface dielectric properties and roughness that cause scattering are time-varying and introduce errors in calculations of elevation change. Recent radar altimeters use synthetic aperture processing (see insar) that increases resolution and decreases slope errors relative to earlier radar altimeters. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) used a C-band radar (5.6 ghz; 54 mm wavelength) and synthetic aperture processing to obtain an accurate map of surface elevations with near-global coverage. Cryosat-2, launched in April 2010, will also use insar to map glaciers and ice sheets.",
Scatterometer,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A radar designed to measure microwave backscattering, quantified as the scattering coefficient or normalized radar cross section 0, from natural media. Exposed glacier ice in the ablation zone lacks a distinctive mass-balance-related signature at microwave wavelengths. In the percolation zone, subsurface ice lenses are strong scatterers, but there is a sharp reduction in backscattering when meltwater appears at the surface. When wet, the surface becomes a more nearly specular (forward) reflector and appears radar-dark instead of radar-bright. In the dry-snow zone radar returns are unaffected by liquid water, which is absent, and the scattering coefficient contains information on snow grain size and possibly on the accumulation rate. Scatterometers have relatively poor spatial resolution (several to some tens of kilometres), which can be improved by temporal averaging, but they compensate by offering wide and frequent coverage. Seawinds, on the polar-orbiting quikscat satellite (1999-2009) has been a productive scatterometer. Intended for the measurement of ocean-surface wind speeds, it has also proved valuable for measuring the extent and duration of melting on ice caps and ice sheets. See also brightness temperature.",
Sonic ranger,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A device that measures the distance to a target, such as the glacier surface, by timing the return of echoes from acoustic (typically ultrasonic) pulses emitted by the device itself. A suitably mounted sonic ranger can yield a continuous record of relative change of surface height and, given information on density changes, can contribute to monitoring of accumulation or ablation. Knowledge is required of the speed of sound in the medium traversed by the pulse and its echo, which may in turn require knowledge of the temperature of the medium. The medium is usually air.",
Speckle tracking,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The measurement of surface velocity as the rate of displacement of correlated patterns of speckle, or noise, in successive radar-interferometric images of the glacier. See insar, radar. The speckle originates from large numbers of statistically independent scatterers in the scene. Small 'chips' or windows from a later image are matched to a similar chip from an earlier image. Measured from the earlier chip, the distance to and bearing of the later chip that exhibits the greatest correlation with the earlier chip is taken to be the vector displacement that has accumulated between the dates of the images. Speckle tracking (e. G. Gray et al. 2001) is less precise than interferometric measurement of velocity but, relying only on image intensity rather than on both the intensity and the phase of the complex radar signal, is more robust. See feature tracking.",
Stake,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A pole or rod that has been emplaced in a vertical hole drilled into the glacier surface; may also be referred to as a mass-balance stake, or as an accumulation stake or ablation stake as appropriate. The change in height of the glacier surface relative to the top of the stake is the basis for a measure of the sum of accumulation and ablation (that is, of surface mass balance). The five quantities measured (Figure 13) over the course of the mass-balance year are at t0, when by definition there is no snow, the distance d0 from the stake top to the summer surface; at tw, the distance dw from the stake top to the surface and (in a nearby snow pit or with a coring device) the mean density w of the snow (if any; the winter balance is not necessarily positive); and at t1, the distance d1 from the stake top to the surface and the mean density 1 of the snow (if any). The layer thicknesses hw and h1are obtained by subtraction, as beneath the figure; note that in the right part of the figure the Annual balance is negative because the thickness h1 is negative. When the balance is positive the stake measurements are often supplemented by digging or probing to sample local variability. It is not possible to measure the density of mass that is lost between any two survey dates. For example the summer balance is commonly evaluated as ba  bw; and when h1 is negative an appropriate value (usually, outside the firn area, the density of ice) must be assumed for 1. At the instant following t1, any residual snow is deemed to become firn and the glacier surface, at d1, becomes the summer surface d0 of the next balance year.",
Stake farm,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A group of stakes placed within a small area on the surface of a glacier, serving to improve estimates of the small-scale variability, and therefore of the sampling uncertainty, of surface mass balance.",
Steam drilling,SwissEdu,Misc,A commonly used field technique to drill holes into ice in order to insert stakes for measuring the mass balance (q.v.) of glaciers.,
