Crevasse trace,SwissEdu,Glaciers,"A long vein of clear ice a few centimetres to a few metres wide, formed as a result of fracture and recrystallisation of ice under tension without separation of the two walls; these structures commonly form parallel to open crevasses and extend into them. Thicker veins of clear ice resulting from the freezing of standing water in open crevasses are also referred to as crevasse traces.",
"crevasse, En-echelon ",SwissEdu,Glaciers,Series of crevasses oriented at an angle to the glacier margin. These form as a result of rotational strain within the ice along the glacier's edge.,
"crevasse, Longitudinal",SwissEdu,Glaciers,A crevasse oriented more or less parallel to the long axis of a glacier. Longitudinal crevasses typically open on a valley glacierwhen the glacier becomes wider.,

Cryoconite hole,AMS,Glaciers,"A small pit in an ice surface produced by the sinking of a particle of dust of cosmic origin (known as cryoconite, a fine-grained dark-colored substance).",
Densification,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The conversion of snow to firn and then to glacier ice. Newly fallen snow has a variable density depending on the meteorological conditions of its formation and deposition. The density of dry snow increases rapidly at first, by the conversion of snowflakes to grains. Then, usually under the pressure of an increasing overburden of newer snow, density increases more slowly by settling of the grains to about 550 kg m-3, representing the maximum practically attainable packing. Snow becomes firn (in the structural sense) over a range of density beginning at about 400 kg m-3.Beyond the maximum packing density, even slower mechanisms of densification  sintering and plastic deformation of the grains, and recrystallization  become dominant. When the firn reaches a density of about 830 kg m-3, the pore spaces between crystals are closed off, air can no longer flow (as opposed to diffusing through the crystal lattices), and the substance is deemed to be glacier ice. When there has been no melting, densification rarely proceeds beyond 400 kg m-3 over the course of a typical mid-latitude winter. Depending on the accumulation (that is, loading) rate, glacier ice may be produced in times from a few years to a few centuries. Melting followed by refreezing can yield bulk densities near that of pure ice in times shorter than a day.",
Density,2-Molnia,Snow,"Density is the ratio of the mass of an object to its volume. Snow has a density averaging about 0.1, firn has a density greater than 0.55, and glacier ice has a density of about 0.89. The density of unmineralized fresh water is 1. Glaciologists measure snowpack density frequently so that they may anticipate future water supplies, and to assess avalanche hazards. The density of a fresh snowpack is about 0.1; firn has a density of about 0.55 and glacier ice, of about 0.89. Each annual snow layer has a characteristic grain size and density.",
Dust,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"An accumulation of aerosol that, when deposited on the surface of a glacier, modifies the mass balance through its effect on surface albedo. Saharan dust, for instance, sometimes has a substantial impact on the mass balance of European glaciers. Volcanic eruptions can deliver dust and ash to nearby, and sometimes to distant, glaciers. In extreme cases the added material can turn the glacier into a debris-covered glacier. Dust can help to define the summer surface, and a dateable dust layer in firn or glacier ice can be useful as a marker horizon.",
Facies,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A collection of attributes serving to distinguish one part of the glacier from others; by extension, the part of the glacier so distinguished. The term, originally Latin for 'face, outward appearance', was borrowed from geology. Examples of diagnostic attributes include ice lenses in the firn, indicating refreezing and therefore the percolation facies; the absence of such lenses, possibly suggesting the dry snow facies; or the seasonal exposure of glacier ice, indicating the ablation facies. In glaciology the term zone is equivalent and is now more common.",

Infiltration,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The entry of a liquid such as water into a permeable solid such as snow or firn, and, more loosely, the percolation of the liquid through the void spaces of the solid. In general, two forces govern infiltration gravity and capillary tension. The latter allows the solid to draw in the liquid and is determined by adhesive molecular forces, which can be substantial in materials with very small pores. The rate of infiltration of a liquid into a permeable solid is determined by the porosity and liquid content of the solid and by its hydraulic conductivity.",

See zone. The infiltration zone is sometimes also referred to as the 'firn-ice zone'.",
Infiltration-congelation zone,IACS-UNESCO,Ice general,"In the Russian-language literature, a synonym of superimposed ice zone. See zone.",
Infiltration-recrystallization zone,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A term in Russian-language usage referring to the lower percolation zone, where enough meltwater is produced at the surface to percolate out of the snow and into the firn. See zone. In the 'cold infiltration-recrystallization zone', generally at higher elevation and sometimes called the 'cold firn zone', the meltwater refreezes in the firn because the temperature is below the freezing point. This refreezing is the dominant mechanism for the formation of glacier ice. In the 'warm infiltration-recrystallization zone', generally at lower elevation and sometimes called the 'warm firn zone', the temperature is at or near the freezing point and refreezing makes a lesser contribution to the formation of ice. The runoff limit may lie within the warm firn zone, or within the cold firn zone where slopes are steep.",

Penitent,IACS-UNESCO 2009,Snow,"A spike or pillar of compacted snow, firn, or glacier ice caused by differential melting and evaporation. It is the extreme relief of sun cups found most often at high altitudes in low latitude regions; the resulting spikes resemble repentant souls.",
Penitent ice,AMS,Ice general,"A spike or pillar of compacted snow, firn, or glacier ice caused by differential melting and evaporation.  Necessary for this formation are 1) air temperature near freezing; 2) dewpoint much below freezing; and 3) strong insolation. Consequently, penitent ice is most developed on low-latitude mountains, especially the Chilean Andes, but has been found in polar regions. Penitents are oriented individually toward the noonday sun, and usually occur in east-west lines. The term is derived from the Spanish nieve penitente (penitent snow), which is still widely used throughout the literature.",
Percolation,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The movement of a liquid such as water through the void spaces of a permeable solid such as snow or firn, the rate of movement being governed by the porosity and liquid content of the solid, the geometric attributes of the pores, including their diameter and tortuosity, and the response of the pore walls to wetting. See infiltration.",
Percolation zone,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The part of the glacier where water from surface melting or rainfall percolates into the subsurface; see percolation, zone. In the upper percolation zone, above the wet-snow line, water percolates only into the snow. In the lower percolation zone, also called the wet-snow zone, water percolates into the firn below the summer surface. The lower percolation zone contains the slush zone. If, having percolated, the water refreezes, it warms its surroundings by releasing latent heat. If it refreezes in the firn, the result is internal accumulation. If it refreezes as a layer immediately above the summer surface, it forms superimposed ice. If this superimposed ice becomes exposed by continued surface ablation, the resulting superimposed ice zone is conventionally regarded as distinct from the percolation zone.",
Phase change,PhysicalGeography.net,Misc,"Reorganization of a substance at the atomic or molecular level resulting in a change of the physical state of matter. For example, a change from solid to liquid to a gas.  ",

See congelation, infiltration ice, glacier. (2) The formation of a new assemblage of crystals from an old assemblage. Sense 1 is the meaning of the term in studies of the densification of snow, while sense 2 is its everyday meaning.",
Recrystallization zone,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"In the Russian-language literature, where it is sometimes also referred to as the 'snow zone', a synonym of dry-snow zone. See zone.",
Refreezing,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The freezing of meltwater generated at the glacier surface, or of rain, that percolates to some depth at which the temperature is below the freezing point. Refreezing below the summer surface represents internal accumulation. Percolating water may also refreeze at the base of snow overlying impermeable glacier ice, in which case it is called superimposed ice. See zone. The release of latent heat heats the layer within which the water freezes.",

Snow metamorphism,IACS-UNESCO 2009,Snow,"The transformation that the snow undergoes in the period from deposition to either melting or passage to glacial ice. Meteorological conditions as well as mechanical or gravitational stresses are the primary external factors that affect snow metamorphism. Dry snow metamorphism is governed by both equilibrium and kinetic growth. In presence of liquid water snow transformation is driven by wet snow metamorphism.
