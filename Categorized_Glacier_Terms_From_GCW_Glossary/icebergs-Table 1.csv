Berg,AMS,Glaciers,Commonly used abbreviation for iceberg.,
"berg, Sugar ",AMS,Ice Sheets and shelves,An iceberg of porous glacier ice.,
Bergy bit,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,Large chunk of glacier ice (a very small iceberg) floating in the sea; bergy bits are usually less than 5 meters (15 feet) in size and are generally spawned from disintegrating icebergs.,
Bergy seltzer,2-Molnia,Glaciers,A crackling or sizzling similar to that made by soft drinks or seltzer water but louder. The sound made as air bubbles formed at many atmospheres of pressure are released during the melting of glacier ice. Also called Ice Sizzle.,
Bottom bergs,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,"Icebergs that originate from near the bottom of a glacier; the color is usually black from trapped rock material or dark blue because of old, coarse, bubble-free ice; they sit low in the water due to the weight of the embedded rocks.",
Calved ice,AMS,Ice Sheets and shelves,A piece of ice floating in a body of water after calving from a mass of land ice or iceberg. (Also called calf.),
Edge wasting,1-NSIDC,Ice Sheets and shelves,Process by which warm water erodes iceberg above the waterline,
Fluted berg,1-NSIDC,Ice Sheets and shelves,An iceberg that is grooved into a curtain-like pattern; thought to be carved by small meltwater streams.,
Growler,1-NSIDC,Ice Sheets and shelves,An iceberg less than 2 meters (6.6 feet) across that floats with less than 1 meter (3.3 feet) showing above water; smaller than a bergy bit.,
Ice island,3-Illustrated Glossary,Ice Sheets and shelves,"A form of tabular berg found in the Arctic Ocean, with a thickness of 30 to 50 m and from a few thousand square m to 500 square km in area. Ice islands often have an undulating surface, which gives them a ribbed appearance from the air.",
Iceberg,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,A piece of ice that has broken off from the end of a glacier that terminates in water.,
Iceberg limit,ECCC,Sea ice,"Sea ice terminology, meaning the limit at any given time between ice of land origin and the open sea or sea ice.",
Iceberg tongue,1-NSIDC,Sea ice,"A major accumulation of icebergs projecting from the coast, held in place by grounding and joined together by fast ice.",
"iceberg, Barrier",AMS,Glaciers,Obsolescent term for tabular iceberg.,
"iceberg, Blocky",ECCC,Sea ice,Sea ice terminology that describes a flat-topped iceberg with steep vertical sides.,
"iceberg, Green",AMS,Ice sheets and shelves,"Desalinated seawater frozen to the base of some Antarctic ice shelves that becomes exposed to view when an iceberg separates from the shelf and capsizes.  The green color of the ice, and of the seawater from which it froze, is due to dissolved organic matter.",
"iceberg, Large",ECCC,Sea ice,"Sea ice terminology that describes a piece of glacier ice extending 46 m to 75 m above sea level, and with a length of 121 m to 200 m.",
"iceberg, Medium",ECCC,Sea ice,"Sea ice terminology meaning a piece of glacier ice extending 16 m to 45 m above sea level, and with a length of 61 m to 120 metres.",
"iceberg, Pinnacled ",ECCC,Sea ice,Sea ice terminology that describes an iceberg that has a central spire or pyramid. This pyramid can have one or more spires.,
"Iceberg, Small ",ECCC,Sea ice,"Sea ice terminology that describes a piece of glacier ice extending 5 m to 15 m above sea level, and with a length of 15 m to 60 meters.",
"iceberg, Tabular ",AMS,Ice Sheets and shelves,"An iceberg that has broken off from an ice shelf. (Also called table iceberg; formerly called barrier iceberg.)  Newly formed tabular icebergs have nearly vertical sides and flat tops. In the Antarctic, they may be tens of kilometers wide, up to 160 km (100 miles) long, and as much as 300 m (1000 ft) thick, with about 30 m (100 ft) exposed above the sea surface. In the Arctic, large icebergs of this type are called ice islands, but they are considerably smaller than the largest of the antarctic variety.",
"iceberg, Very large ",ECCC,Sea ice,"Sea ice terminology. Describes a piece of glacier ice that extends more than 75 m above sea level, and has a length of more than 200 metres.",
"iceberg, Wedged",ECCC,Sea ice,"Sea ice terminology. Describes an iceberg which is rather flat on top, with steep vertical sides on one end, sloping to less steep sides on the other end.",
Mean iceberg limit,ECCC,Sea ice,"Sea ice terminology. Describes the average position of the limit of icebergs at any given time, based on observations over a number of years.",
Median iceberg limit,ECCC,Sea ice,Sea ice terminology describing the position where the historical or statistical frequency of occurrence of the iceberg limit is 50 per cent.,
