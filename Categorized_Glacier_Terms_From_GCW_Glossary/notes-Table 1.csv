Notes on methods,,,,
"cut and paste from full glossary to glacier, all occurrences, in most cases. But sometimes when the term applied not exclusively to glaciers I move only one occurrence.",,,,
"highlight in yellow problems in original glossary, may need to see copies of the term in both worksheets",,,,
I remove most but not all of esoteric glacier terms,,,,
didn't copy all the geologic epocs,,,,
didn't all terms related to observational tech.  E.g. did copy lidar but not scatterometer,,,,
"remove ""glacial"" adjectives where can be implied, plurals, put modifiers after root term",,,,
,,,,
combine terms referring to ,,,,

landforms created or associated with glaciers,,,,
