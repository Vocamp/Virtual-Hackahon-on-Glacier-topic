As the glacier begins to float free and rises off the bottom it rapidly comes apart along old fracture scars and crevasses. For example, at Bering Glacier, in the Chugach Mountains, Alaska, a single observed disarticulation event resulted in nearly 2/3 of a mile of terminus retreat in a single day.

Flowline,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"(1) A sequence of columns of infinitesimal cross section, each extending vertically from base to surface of the glacier, arranged so that each column but the first gains mass by flow from an upglacier neighbour and each column except possibly the last loses mass by flow to a downglacier neighbour. (2) The trace of such a sequence on the glacier surface. Ideally, the upglacier and downglacier walls of all the columns would be at right angles to the local horizontal velocity vector. It is assumed that flow through the other two walls of the columns may be neglected, by allowing an implicit relative width of the flowline to vary and thus to account for transverse straining. In practice, velocity measurements are usually sparse or lacking and it is necessary to construct the flowline from the surface topography. The topography is averaged within a radius of the order of the glacier thickness, to suppress the effect on calculations that might be exerted by short-wavelength topographic features that are not due to the glacier flow.

Ice crystal,AMS,Snow,"Any one of a number of macroscopic, crystalline forms in which ice appears, including hexagonal columns, hexagonal platelets, dendritic crystals, ice needles, and combinations of these forms.  The crystal lattice of ice is hexagonal in its symmetry under most atmospheric conditions. Varying conditions of temperature and vapor pressure can lead to growth of crystalline forms in which the simple hexagonal pattern is present in widely different habits (a thin hexagonal plate or a long thin hexagonal column). In many ice crystals, trigonal symmetry can be observed, suggesting an influence of a cubic symmetry. The principal axis (c axis) of a single crystal of ice is perpendicular to the axis of hexagonal symmetry. Planes perpendicular to this axis are called basal planes (a axes related to the prism facets) and present a hexagonal cross section. Ice is anisotropic in both its optical and electrical properties and has a high dielectric constant (even higher than water) resulting from its water dipole structure. The electrical relaxation time for water is much shorter than for ice (10^9 Hz compared with 10^4 Hz), resulting from a chain reaction requirement for molecules to relax through defects in the ice lattice. In the free air, ice crystals compose cirrus-type clouds, and near the ground they form the hydrometeor called, remarkably enough, ""ice crystals"" (or ice prisms). They are one constituent of ice fog, the other constituent being droxtals. On terrestrial objects the ice crystal is the elemental unit of hoarfrost in all of its various forms. Ice crystals that form in slightly supercooled water are termed frazil. Ice originating as frozen water (e.g., hail, graupel, and lake ice) still has hexagonal symmetry but lacks any external hexagonal form. Analysis of their sections (0.5 mm) in polarized light reveals different crystal shapes and orientations, depending on the freezing and any annealing and subsequent recrystallization process.",
Ice discharge,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Mass flux or volumetric flux of ice through a glacier cross section or 'gate'. The gate can be anywhere on the glacier, but is often at or close to the terminus. If the terminus is a calving front, ice discharge is usually in discrete pieces that, when discharged into a body of water, become icebergs, and the ice discharge is equivalent to the calving flux plus the flux due to advance (positive) or retreat (negative) of the calving front. Avalanching from the glacier margin, for example from the margin of a hanging glacier, may constitute ice discharge; see also dry calving.",

Land ice,AMS,Ice general,"Any part of the earth's seasonal or perennial ice cover that has formed over land as the result, principally, of the freezing of precipitation; opposed to sea ice formed by the freezing of seawater.  Thus, an iceberg or tabular iceberg is land ice as well as its parent glacier, ice sheet, or ice shelf. The two major concentrations of land ice are the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Glaciers and ice caps are the other important forms.",
Lobe,PhysicalGeography.net,Glaciers,"A tongue-like extension of some material. For example, the ice lobe of an alpine glacier.",
Lobed,GLIMS Manual,Glaciers,"Initial stage of tongue formation (occurs on both micro and macro scales); In many cases part of an ice sheet, cap, field; Large or small scale radial ice margin; Is not an outlet or a valley glacier; If it terminates into sea, use class 'calving and lobed'; Part of an ice sheet or ice cap, disqualified as an outlet glacier (WGMS 1970, 1998); Tongue like form of an icefield or ice cap.

See also accreted ice.",
Melt extent,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The spatial extent (dimension [L2]) of melting on the surface of the glacier. The melt extent can be measured by microwave remote sensing of the brightness temperature with a passive-microwave sensor, or equivalent analysis of radar or scatterometer imagery.

Meltwater discharge,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The rate of flow through a cross section, usually a stream cross section, of water produced by melting of glacier ice, firn or snow that is removed from the glacier in surface, englacial or subglacial flows. See runoff. The measured discharge may include a contribution from rainfall on the glacier, and typically includes contributions from unglacierized parts of the drainage basin. Meltwater discharge is always reported as volume per unit time.",
Meltwater runoff,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The component of runoff (in sense 2) produced by melting of glacier ice, firn or snow that is removed in surface, englacial or subglacial flows. Meltwater runoff is not the same as surface ablation by melting, because surface meltwater may refreeze in the glacier (see refreezing, internal accumulation), and part of the meltwater runoff may originate from basal ablation or internal ablation. Nor is it usually the same as the total runoff, which is likely to include contributions from unglacierized parts of the drainage basin, and may include a contribution from rainfall on the glacier.",
Mid-range altitude,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The average of the minimum altitude and maximum altitude of the glacier.

Rapid dynamical change,IPCC WGI AR5 2013,Glaciers,"Changes in glacier or ice sheet mass controlled by changes in flow speed and discharge rather than by accumulation or ablation. This can result in a rate of mass change larger than that due to any imbalance between accumulation and ablation. Rapid dynamical change may be initiated by a climatic trigger, such as incursion of warm ocean water beneath an ice shelf, or thinning of a grounded tidewater terminus, which may lead to reactions within the glacier system, that may result in rapid ice loss. See also Mass balance/budget (of glaciers or ice sheets).",

D-1 or kg m-2 s-1. (2) The flux of water leaving the glacier. Sense 2 is common in mass-balance studies, especially in studies of ice-sheet mass balance. See mass-balance units; it is useful to have one word for total flux and a different word for specific flux, so the distinction between discharge and runoff is to be encouraged. Runoff includes meltwater discharge but also water from other sources than melt, such as rainfall.",

Sorge's law,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The proposition that a glacier with a constant accumulation rate and no melting has a constant profile of density as a function of depth beneath the surface; by extension, and more loosely, the proposition that an unchanging density profile is sustained by the climatic mass balance. It follows from Sorge's law that a thickness change can be converted to an equivalent change of mass by multiplying by the density of glacier ice. This approach has been used in most mass-balancecalculations by geodetic methods. Sorge's law was originally introduced to describe densification of high polar snowpacks where melt is negligible. When Sorge's law is invoked in its looser sense, the constancy of the density profile is usually assumed rather than measured. The name, given by Bader (1954) in recognition of Ernst Sorge's observations in Greenland in 19301931, is pronounced as two syllables, the first stressed, with s as English z and with hard g.",

Submergence velocity,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The vertical component, when it is directed downward, of the glacier-flow velocity vector at the glacier surface, at a point fixed in space. When the component is directed upward, it is called the emergence velocity. The submergence velocity is related through the continuity equation to the climatic-basal mass balance and the rate of thickness change. The component is typically upward in the ablation zone and downward in the accumulation zone.",
Surge,2-Molnia,Glaciers,"A short-lived, frequently large-scale, increase in the rate of movement of the ice within a glacier. Ice velocities may increase 10 to 100 times above normal flow rates. In some surges, the terminus of a glacier rapidly advances. Although not all glaciers surge, those that do often surge with some sort of a periodicity.",
Surge front,SwissEdu,Glaciers,"The zone of intense compression between surging ice and non-surging ice. This is commonly marked by a bulge and a transition from heavily crevassed to crevasse-free ice. The surge front rapidly moves through the glacier, and if it reaches the snout, the glacier advances.",
Terminus,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,"The lowest end of a glacier, also called the glacier toe or glacier snout.",
Thickness,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The vertical distance between any two surfaces, and in particular between the glacier face and the summer surface, or the glacier surface and the bed. Glacier thickness is measured ideally by interpolating from a dense array of point measurements, constructed for example from ground-penetrating radar traverses. However the measurement density is often less than ideal, as when the array consists of a single traverse or even just a small number of boreholes. On most glaciers there are no thickness measurements at all and the thickness must be estimated, for example by volume-area scaling or as a function of surface slope and estimated basal shear stress. The definition of thickness as a vertical distance is adopted almost invariably in studies of mass balance, but not in all branches of cryospheric science. For example Fierz et al. (2009) define thickness as the coordinate normal to the slope, measured from the base of a layer of snow.",
Thickness change,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The change in the thickness of the glacier at a defined horizontal location. Thickness can change at a point due to ablation and accumulation at the surface and bottom of the glacier, compaction of snow and firn, or a non-zero emergence velocity or submergence velocity. Thickness change is often used interchangeably with elevation change, but the two are not necessarily the same. For example, elevation can change due to glacial isostatic adjustment or vertical tectonic motions, without a change in glacier thickness. The thickness change at a point is not equivalent to the climatic-basal mass balance at that point because the thickness change may be due in part to emergence or submergence. Thickness change at a point is therefore not a direct indicator of the local climate. The glacier-wide mean thickness change is the volume change of the entire glacier divided by the mean glacier area during the time span of the measurements: 2(h V VS S 21)/(21) , where V is volume, S is area, and subscripts 1 and 2 refer to measurements at an earlier and later time, respectively. The quantity 21( ) V V V is the volume change. Usually the two volumes are not known separately, and: V is obtained from measurements of by geodetic methods. The mean thickness change, if multiplied by the density of the mass gained or lost, is equal to the glacier-wide mass balance over the period of the thickness change. The mean thickness change differs from the change of mean thickness, which is V2/S2  V1/S1.",
Thomson crystal,1-NSIDC,Snow,"A large ice crystal found in deep, stagnant water-filled cavities of a glacier.",
Thrust,SwissEdu,Glaciers,"A low-angle fault, usually formed where the ice is under compression. Thrusts commonly extend from the bed and are associated with debris and overturned folds.",
Tidewater instability,IACS-UNESCO,Sea ice,"Unsteady, perhaps quasi-periodic, behaviour (Meier and Post 1987) of a tidewater glacier that undergoes alternating episodes of slow advance and rapid retreat. The conditions permitting advance to the advanced position in the first place, and the triggers for subsequent unstable retreat, are both poorly understood, although they may involve variations in basal water pressure and probably involve variations of the climatic mass balance. Once retreat has begun, however, observation and simulation (Schoof 2007) agree that, if the bed is grounded below sea level but has a slope opposed to that of the surface, the retreat will continue until the grounding line reaches a part of the bed that slopes in the same direction as the surface. During this unstable retreat, enhanced calving leads to a positive feedback in which accelerated flow and dynamic thinning extend far upglacier from the part that is grounded below sea level. Mass loss is far greater than, and essentially independent of, the climatic mass balance.",
toe,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,The lowest end of a glacier; also called glacier snout or terminus.,
Tongue,1-NSIDC,Freshwater ice,A projection of the ice edge up to several km in length caused by wind and current; usually forms when a valley glacier moves very quickly into a lake or ocean.,

"tongue, Ice",AMS,Glaciers,"Any narrow extension of a glacier or ice shelf, such as a projection floating in the sea or an outlet glacier of an ice cap.",
Tuya,2-Molnia,Glaciers,"A volcano that erupted under a glacier. Because volcanic activity in western Canada was contemporaneous with the ebb and flow of Cordilleran glaciations, many of the volcanoes display ice contact features. Mount Garibaldi itself is a supraglacial volcano which erupted onto a regional ice sheet. Others, such as Hoodoo Mountain, were contained within basins thawed in the ice and assumed the flat-topped form of tuyas. Still others, such as the subglacial mounds of the Clearwater Field, were erupted under glacial ice to form piles of pillow lava and hyaloclastite.",
