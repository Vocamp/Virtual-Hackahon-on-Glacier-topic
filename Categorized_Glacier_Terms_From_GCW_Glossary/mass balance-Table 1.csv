"AAR, Annual",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The AAR at the end of the mass-balance year. Annual AARs can vary greatly from year to year, but an average over a number of years, when compared with the Balanced-budget AAR, gives a measure of the health of the glacier. If the difference is large and in the same direction over a considerable time, a prolonged period of non-zero mass balance can be expected as the glacier seeks equilibrium.",
"AAR, Balanced-budget ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The AAR, sometimes denoted AAR0, of a glacier with a mass balance equal to zero. Glaciers do not in general have mass balances equal to zero. The Balanced-budget AAR is usually estimated as the AAR at which a curve (often linear) fitted to a relation between AAR and the Annual surface mass balance Bsfc, observed over a number of years, crosses the axis Bsfc = 0. The AAR0 of non-calving glaciers has been found to vary roughly between 0.5 and 0.6 on average, although the range of variation is substantial. On calving glaciers it is typically larger, approaching 1.0 on the Antarctic Ice Sheet. AAR0 can exceed 0.8 on tropical glaciers of year-round ablation type. The Balanced-budget AAR may differ from the steady-state AAR because it summarizes observations made in conditions that may not approximate to steady state.",
"AAR, Equilibrium ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,A synonym of Balanced-budget AAR.,
"AAR, Steady-state ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The AAR of a glacier in steady state. The steady-state AAR is difficult to estimate because glaciers are seldom if ever in steady state. In practice, it must be estimated by modelling. To emphasize that the Balanced-budget AAR and steady-state AAR are distinct concepts, the steady-state AAR should be given a distinctive symbol, perhaps AAR0'.",
"AAR, Transient ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"The AAR at any instant, particularly during the ablation season.",
Ablation,2-Molnia,Snow,"Ablation refers to all processes by which snow, ice, or water in any form are lost from a glacier. Ablation is the loss of snow or ice by evaporation and melting. The rate at which ablation occurs depends on the atmospheric conditions present, such as air moisture content, solar radiation, temperature, and the reflectivity (Albedo) of the snow or ice surface. Fresh snow has a high albedo (0.7 to 0.9), indicating that 70 to 90 percent of the radiation received is reflected; glacier ice has a lower albedo of 0.2 to 0.4. Therefore, more radiation may be absorbed by glacier ice than by snow. Glaciers around the mountain receive different amounts of sunlight, so each glacier has its own characteristic ablation pattern.",
Ablation area,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,The area of a glacier where more glacier mass is lost than gained.,
Ablation cone,SwissEdu,Landform,"See dirt cone: A thin veneer of debris draping a cone of ice up to several metres high, formed because the debris has retarded ablation under it.",
Ablation hollows,1-NSIDC,Snow,"Depressions in the snow surface caused by the sun or warm, gusty wind.",
Ablation moraine,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,Mound or layer of moraine in the ablation zone of a glacier the rock has been plucked from the mountainside by the moving glacier and is melting out on the ice surface.,
Ablation season,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A time span extending from a seasonal maximum of glacier mass to a seasonal minimum. The ablation season is the same as the summer season on most glaciers, which are of winter-accumulation type. Special cases include glaciers of summer-accumulation type and year-round ablation type, and glaciers that have more than one ablation season during the year.",
"ablation, Annual",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,Ablation integrated over the mass-balance year. Annual ablation is the sum of winter ablation and summer ablation where winter and summer are well-differentiated. Formerly it was referred to as 'total ablation' when working in the stratigraphic system.,
"ablation, Basal ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The removal of ice by melting at the base of a glacier. At the base of grounded temperate ice, melting is either fuelled by the geothermal heat flux and the conversion of the kinetic energy of basal sliding to heat, or results from variations of the pressure-melting point. Pressure melting, however, tends to be balanced by regelation. Typical continental geothermal heat fluxes G of 0.050.15 W m-2 imply potential basal ablation G/Lf of 514 mm w. E. A-1, where Lf is the latent heat of fusion. Much greater geothermal heat fluxes are found in areas of Active volcanism. If all of the energy of basal sliding is converted to heat, basal ablation ubb/Lf at rates of 330 mm w. E. A-1 is implied by sliding velocities ub of 10100 m a-1 and basal shear stress b of 105 Pa. Basal ablation rates tens or hundreds of times greater are implied beneath ice streams. At the base of an ice shelf or floating tongue, melting occurs because of convection of warmer sea water to the ice-water interface, supplying the required latent heat of fusion. The rate of melting depends on the temperature of the sea water and the efficiency of the heat transfer between the seawater and the base of the ice shelf. Basal ablation rates beneath ice shelves or floating tongues can reach tens of m w. E. A-1, equivalent to heat transfer at hundreds of W m-2.",
"ablation, Internal ",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"Loss of mass from a glacier by melting of ice or firn between the summer surface and the bed. See mass-balance units. Internal ablation can occur due to strain heating of temperate ice as the ice deforms. However, the largest heat sources for internal ablation are likely to be the potential energy released by downward motion of the ice and of meltwater. The magnitude of the former is equivalent to a few mm w. E. A-1, and of the latter, which occurs mainly in conduits transferring water from the glacier surface to the bed, to up to a few tens of mm w. E. A-1. (These rates are expressed over the extent of a typical valley glacier.)",
"ablation, Net ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"The sum, if negative, of accumulation and ablation over any time period; if the sum is positive then net ablation is zero. In the ablation zone the net ablation is equal to the mass balance.",
"ablation, Summer ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,Ablation integrated over the summer season. Summer ablation is not the same as summer mass balance. It is generally more negative because some of the lost mass may be offset by accumulation. Mass-balance measurements by the glaciological method generally measure summer mass balance and not summer ablation.,
"ablation, Surface ",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"Ablation at the surface of the glacier, generally measured as the lowering of the surface with respect to the summer surface, corrected for the increase in density of any residual snow and firn and multiplied by the density of the lost mass.",
"ablation, Total ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,A term formerly used in the stratigraphic system (Anonymous 1969; Appendix: A) for Annual ablation.,
"ablation, Winter ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,Ablation integrated over the winter season.,
Accumulation,1-NSIDC,Snow,"All processes by which snow or ice are added to a glacier, this is typically the accumulation of snow, which is slowly transformed into ice; other accumulation processes can include avalanches, wind-deposited snow, and the freezing of rain within the snow pack.",
Accumulation area,2-Molnia,Snow,The part of a glacier that is perennially covered with snow.,
Accumulation season,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A time span extending from a seasonal minimum of glacier mass to a seasonal maximum. The accumulation season is the same as the winter season on most glaciers, which are of winter-accumulation type. Special cases include glaciers of summer-accumulation type and year-round ablation type, and glaciers that have more than one accumulation season during the year.",
Accumulation zone,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The part of the glacier where accumulation exceeds ablation in magnitude, that is, where the cumulative mass balance relative to the start of the mass-balance year is positive. Unless qualified, for example by giving a date within the year, references to the accumulation zone refer to its extent at the end of the mass-balance year. The extent of the accumulation zone can vary strongly from year to year. The accumulation zone is not the same as the firn area.",
Accumulation-area ratio AAR,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The ratio, often expressed as a percentage, of the area of the accumulation zone to the area of the glacier. The AAR is bounded between 0 and 1. On many glaciers it correlates well with the climatic mass balance. The likelihood that the climatic mass balance will be positive increases as the AAR approaches 1. Unless qualified by a different adjective, references to the AAR refer to the Annual AAR.",
"accumulation, Annual",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,Accumulation integrated over the mass-balance year. Annual accumulation is the sum of winter accumulation and summer accumulation where winter and summer are well-differentiated. Formerly it was referred to as 'total accumulation' when working in the stratigraphic system.,
"accumulation, Basal ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The freezing of water to the base of the glacier, increasing the mass of the glacier and Antarctic Ice Sheeting its basal temperature if that temperature is below the freezing point. The result of basal accumulation is typically observable in ice cores or at glacier margins as accreted ice that is relatively clear, often with some concentration of dispersed sediments incorporated from the glacier bed during freezing. Accreted ice may also be distinguishable from glacier ice (the latter sometimes referred to as meteoric ice in this context) by differences in isotopic content, geochemical composition and optical properties, and may have distinctive dielectric properties by which it can be recognized in ground-penetrating radar records. Accreted ice at the base of an ice shelf is referred to as marine ice. For purposes of the glaciological method, basal accumulation is indistinguishable from internal accumulation in that both represent addition of mass to the glacier that goes unaccounted for by surface observations.",
"accumulation, Internal ",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"Refreezing of water within a glacier, between the summer surface and the bed, which goes undetected by measurements of surface mass balance. See mass-balance units, zone. Accumulation beneath the summer surface is the refreezing of surface meltwater (or freezing of rain) that is in transit and otherwise would have left the glacier as runoff. In the case of meltwater, it may be regarded as redistributing mass within the glacier. This may require careful accounting in the calculation of mass balance. Internal accumulation proceeds by the freezing of water that percolates early in the ablation season into firn that is still cold, heating the firn in the process, or by the freezing of retained pore water during the accumulation season, also releasing latent heat and thus slowing the downward advance of the winter cold wave. The term is reserved for refreezing beneath the summer surface, that is, within the firn or the ice. Meltwater that refreezes within the snow does not constitute internal accumulation since it is accounted for by end-of-season density measurements as part of conventional mass-balance measurements. Internal accumulation may be small in magnitude, and negligible on temperate glaciers, but if not accounted for it constitutes a bias towards overestimation of mass loss. In remote-sensing studies, it is not always possible to detect the summer surface. In addition models of the surface mass balance do not always distinguish between internal accumulation and refreezing within the snow. To avoid confusion, it is advisable to use 'internal accumulation' only in the sense given above and to use the more inclusive 'refreezing' only for 'internal accumulation plus refreezing within the snow'. Refreezing within the snow should be described as such explicitly.",
"accumulation, Net ",IACS-UNESCO,Ice general,"The sum, if positive, of accumulation and ablation over any time period; if the sum is negative then net accumulation is zero. In the accumulation zone the net accumulation is equal to the mass balance. The term appears often in ice-core studies, where the layer thickness is related to the mass balance.",
"accumulation, Summer ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,Accumulation integrated over the summer season. Part or all of summer accumulation may be lost by ablation before the end of the summer season.,
"accumulation, Surface ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Accumulation at the surface of the glacier, generally measured as the rise of the surface with respect to the summer surface multiplied by the density of the added mass.",
"accumulation, Total ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,A term formerly used in the stratigraphic system (Anonymous 1969; Appendix A/1 /2or Annual accumulation.,
"accumulation, Winter ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,Accumulation integrated over the winter season. Winter accumulation is not the same as winter mass balance. It is generally larger because some of the accumulated mass may be lost by ablation. Mass-balance measurements by the glaciological method generally measure winter mass balance and not winter accumulation.,
advance,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,When a mountain glacier's terminus extends farther downvalley than before; occurs when a glacier flows downvalley faster than the rate of ablation at its terminus.,
Alimentation,WMO METEOTERM,Glaciers,"Various processes which operate to increase the mass of a glacier or of a snow-field (deposition of snow, precipitation, sublimation, etc.)",
Annual exchange,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Annual accumulation minus Annual ablation. Ablation is defined to be negative, so the Annual exchange may also be regarded as the sum of the absolute values of accumulation and ablation. It is a possible measure of the amplitude of mass exchange between the glacier and its environment, but the mass-balance amplitude is more often used for that purpose. Formerly Annual exchange was defined only in the fixed-date system and total exchange was defined as its equivalent in the stratigraphic system.",
Area S,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Extent in two spatial dimensions, always understood in mass-balance work (when the two dimensions are horizontal) to be map area, that is, the extent of the glacier or part thereof when the glacier outline is projected onto the surface of an ellipsoid approximating the surface of the Earth or onto a planar (horizontal) approximation to that ellipsoid. In mass-balance studies, except for ice discharge and for the special case of frontal ablation, lengths such as layer thicknesses are always measured parallel to the vertical axis and not normal to the glacier surface. When calculating volumes within a specified outline, the area to be used is therefore the integral of ds (an element of projected area) and not the integral of sec ds, the so-called 'true' area (where is the slope of the glacier surface). The glacier area excludes nunataks but includes debris-covered parts of the glacier. However, delineating the glacier where it is debris-covered can be very difficult, because the debris may cover stagnant ice and there may be no objective way to distinguish between the debris-covered glacier and contiguous ice-cored moraine.",
Area-averaged,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,Descriptive of a quantity that has been averaged over part or all of the area of the glacier. The area-averaged mass balance is simply the specific mass balance of the region under consideration. The adjective has sometimes been used to emphasize that the specific mass balance is that of the whole glacier and not of a 'specific' location. 'Mean specific mass balance' has been used in the same sense.,
Avalanching,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"Mass transfer by avalanches which redistribute snow, firn and ice. Avalanching from a valley wall to the glacier surface constitutes accumulation. Avalanching from the glacier margin constitutes ablation.",
Balance flux,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The hypothetical horizontal mass flux (dimension [M T-1]) through a vertical cross section that would be equal to the mass balance (usually the climatic mass balance) over the region upglacier from the cross section. Comparison of balance flux and actual mass flux at the same cross section gives an indication of the health of the glacier. If the mass balance of the glacier is zero it follows that at the terminus the balance flux and mass flux are equal, and if there is also no calving that they are equal to zero. If the two are equal at all cross sections the glacier is in steady state.",
Balance velocity,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The volumetric balance flux divided by the area of the vertical cross section through which it passes. Comparison of balance velocity to actual velocity, that is, to the actual volumetric flux (mass flux divided by average density) divided by the area of the vertical cross section, gives an indication of the health of the glacier.",
"balance, Net ",AMS,Glaciers,The mass balance at the end of the balance year.  It represents the annual addition or loss of mass at a point on a glacier. ,
"balance, Reference-surface ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The glacier-wide mass balance that would have been observed if the glacier surface topography had not changed since a reference date. The time-invariant surface is called the 'reference surface', and is defined at some convenient time within a mass-balance programme, often at the start. The reference-surface balance is obtained when point measurements are extrapolated from their actual altitude to the altitude of the reference surface at the same horizontal position, and then extrapolated over the reference area. The reference surface is likely to differ from the actual surface in both area and area-altitude distribution. Differences in area and area-altitude distribution feed back on the magnitude of glacier response to climate. The reference-surface balance does not incorporate any of these feedback effects and is therefore more closely correlated to variations in climate than is the conventional balance.",
Balanced-budget,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,Descriptive of a glacier with a mass balance equal to zero on average over a number of years.,
Basal mass balance,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,The change in the mass of the glacier due to basal accumulation and basal ablation over a stated period.,
Benchmark glacier,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"In the monitoring strategy of the United States Geological Survey, a glacier on which detailed measurements of seasonal glacier mass changes, meteorological environment, and stream flow variations are collected on a continuing basis.",
"budget, Net ",3-Illustrated Glossary,Glaciers,The difference between accumulation and ablation; usually expressed in terms of volumes of water equivalent per unit area.,
Calve,1-NSIDC,Ice Sheets and shelves,Break off from a larger ice shelf or ice sheet into the water.,
Calving,1-NSIDC,Freshwater ice,"Process by which ice breaks off a glacier's terminus usually the term is reserved for tidewater glaciers or glaciers that end in lakes, but it can refer to ice that falls from hanging glaciers.",
Calving flux,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The mass flux, with dimension [M T-1], of ice by calving from a glacier margin.",
Calving front,IACS-UNESCO,Freshwater ice,"A glacier margin from which discrete pieces of ice calve or break off, to become icebergs if the margin stands or floats in sea or lake water.",
Calving rate,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"Either the calving flux or the calving velocity, depending on the context.",
Calving velocity,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The volumetric calving flux divided by the area of projection of the calving glacier margin onto a vertical plane normal to the mean direction of the ice flow. Denoting horizontal velocity components in the direction of the ice flow as u, the calving velocity ucalv can be determined by application of the principle of conservation of mass at the glacier margin: calvu u u L Lbalthin, where ubal is the balance velocity, uthin is the thinning velocity and llis the rate of change of the glacier's length reckoned from a fixed point upglacier from the margin.",
Coffee-can method,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A means of measuring the submergence velocity or emergence velocity of the glacier surface by anchoring a stand for a global navigation satellite system (GNSS; usually a Global Positioning System) receiver to the body of the glacier, using a suitable object (such as a coffee can) as an anchor connected to the surface by a cable under tension. The essence of the method is that measured changes in the exposed length of the cable (or equivalent measurements of the local surface mass balance), and in the surface elevation (measured by the GNSS receiver), yield two of the three terms in the continuity equation and allow the third term, the submergence or emergence velocity (that is, the flux divergence) to be determined. Corrections may be needed for the densification (that is, settling) of firn beneath the anchor and for downslope advection of the anchor. The coffee-can method has been used mainly in the accumulation zones of ice sheets, where the surface mass balance can be obtained by ice-core stratigraphy. However in the ablation zone the emergence of cables emplaced for other reasons, such as the measurement of temperature profiles, can serve a similar purpose.",
Conventional balance,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The mass balance of a glacier, the term having been introduced by Elsberg et al. (2001) to distinguish the mass balance from the reference-surface balance, which is the balance the glacier would have if the glacier surface geometry were fixed in time. Conventional balances are obtained when point measurements over a particular time interval are extrapolated to the glacier area and area-altitude distribution measured during the same time interval. Calculations of conventional balance require repeated mapping of glacier hypsometry at intervals appropriate to the rate of change of the surface geometry. However, maps are often re-calculated at longer time intervals, the reported balances being a combination of conventional and reference-surface balances. Conventional balances are relevant for hydrological applications because they represent the actual mass change of a glacier. Conventional balances are not simply correlated to variations in climate because they incorporate both climate forcing and changes in glacier hypsometry. For glacier/climate investigations the reference-surface balance is a more relevant quantity.",
Cumulative mass balance,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The mass of the glacier, or part of the glacier, at a stated time relative to its mass at some earlier time t0, considered as a function of time, M (t)  M (t0).",
Downwasting,2-Molnia,Glaciers,The thinning of a glacier due to the melting of ice. This loss of thickness may occur in both moving and stagnant ice. Also called Thinning.,
Dry calving,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Ice discharge from a glacier margin onto land, usually in discrete pieces.",
Dry-snow line,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,The set of points on a glacier separating the dry-snow zone from the percolation zone. See zone.,
Dry-snow zone,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,Region of the glacier where there is neither surface melting nor rainfall. See zone.,
Dynamic thinning,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The reduction of glacier thickness, in excess of that due to ablation, that results when the flux divergence is positive, that is, when more mass flows out of the thinning region than flows in. See downwasting. Dynamic thinning, when not compensated by thickening in a downstream part of the glacier, implies an enhanced calving flux at the glacier terminus, or an advance of the terminus, or both. See also calving velocity.",
"ELA, Balanced-budget ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The ELA, sometimes denoted ELA0, of a glacier with a climatic mass balance equal to zero on average over a number of years. The Balanced-budget ELA is usually estimated as the altitude at which a curve fitted to an observed relation between Annual ELA and Annual mass balance Ba crosses the axis Ba = 0. The uncertainty in such estimates can be substantial, especially when mass-balance sampling is sparse or the equilibrium zone occupies a large fraction of the glacier surface. The Balanced-budget ELA may differ from the steady-state ELA because it is estimated from observations made in conditions that may not approximate to steady state. In particular, most measurements of mass balance published over the past several decades have been negative.",
"ELA, Steady-state ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The ELA of a glacier in steady state. The steady-state ELA is difficult to estimate because glaciers are seldom if ever in steady state. It must usually be estimated by modelling. To emphasize that the Balanced-budget ELA and steady-state ELA are distinct concepts, the steady-state ELA should be given a distinctive symbol, perhaps ELA0.",
"ELA, Transient ",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The ELA at any instant, particularly during the ablation season. The transient ELA is not in general the same as the average altitude of the transient snowline. The superimposed ice zone lies below the transient snowline and above the transient ELA.",
Elevation change,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"Vertical changing glacier surface elevation (altitude), typically derived from two elevation measurements, adjusted if necessary for the difference of their respective datum surfaces, at the same (or nearly the same) horizontal coordinates. The elevation of the surface can change due to (i) ablation and accumulation at the surface and bottom of the glacier; (ii) compaction (densification) of snow and firn; (iii) emergence and submergence resulting from ice flow; (iv) changes in subglacial water pressure; (v) tectonic and isostatic movements of the glacier bed; and (vi) geomorphic processes (abrasion, plucking; lodgement of sediment) at the bed. Changes due to (iv) and (vi) can usually be neglected in mass-balance studies, although a correction is sometimes applied for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Surface elevation change is usually similar to thickness change, but (ivvi) above produce elevation changes without changes of the thickness or glacier mass, while (ii) above produces a decrease of thickness with no accompanying change of mass. See continuity equation, geodetic method. In turn, large changes of glacier thickness lead to isostatic changes of the bed elevation.",
Energy balance,IACS-UNESCO,Freshwater ice,"A relation describing the change in the amount of energy stored within a defined volume owing to flows of energy across the boundary of the volume. A change in the amount of stored energy, due for example to the advection or conduction of heat or the absorption or emission of radiation, will result in a change in the temperature or the phase, or both, of the material in the volume. Phase changes, in particular melting and freezing but also sublimation and deposition, couple the energy balance strongly to the mass balance. For example they determine the amount of ablation by melting and sublimation, and so the energy balance must be determined using either an energy-balance model or a temperature-index model in any attempt to model ablation. The surface energy balance is that of an interface or degenerate volume, the thickness of which approaches zero, at the surface of the glacier. Glaciers also have internal and basal energy balances. In cold glaciers and some polythermal glaciers, the largest component of the internal energy balance is usually the heat source due to refreezing. In both the internal and basal energy balances, friction is a mechanical source of heat and heat is conducted (or advected) between adjacent volumes that are not isothermal. The geothermal heat flux is usually a significant term in the basal energy balance and basal mass balance of grounded ice, but the resulting contribution to the climatic-basal mass balance is generally small. Exchanges of heat with sea or lake water must be considered where the ice is afloat.",
Energy of glacierization,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"A less-used synonym of activity index, appearing mainly in the Russian-language literature.",
Energy-balance model,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"A model of mass balance in which ablation by melting and sublimation is estimated by solving the surface energy balance. Energy balance models require more input information than temperature-index models, but are preferred for being based on a more complete description of processes, and for superior accuracy when the input information can be supplied accurately.",
Equilibrium,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A state in which the mass balance is equal to zero over one or more years. Equilibrium may hold for a single column, for an entire flowline, or for an entire glacier. See steady state.",
Equilibrium line,2-Molnia,Misc,Equilibrium line is the boundary between the accumulation area and the ablation area.,
equilibrium line. Annual ,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"The equilibrium line at the end of the mass-balance year. At the Annual equilibrium line, Annual ablation balances Annual accumulation and the Annual mass balance is zero.",
Equilibrium zone,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,Zone of a glacier in which the amount of precipitation that falls is equal to the amount that melts the following summer.,
Equilibrium-line altitude ELA,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The spatially averaged altitude of the equilibrium line. The ELA may be determined by direct visual observation, but is generally determined, in the context of mass-balance measurements, by fitting a curve to data representing surface mass balance as a function of altitude (see mass-balance profile). This is often an idealization, because the equilibrium line tends to span a range of altitudes. Many approximations of the ELA have been suggested; the glaciation level and the mid-range altitude are examples. The ELA is understood to be the Annual ELA unless it is qualified as the transient ELA.",
Eustacy,2-Molnia,Glaciers,"Fluctuations in the worldwide sea-level regime caused by changes in the quantity of seawater available. The greatest changes are caused by water being added to, or removed from, glaciers.",
Flux-divergence method,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Application of the continuity equation to determine mass balance at a point using measurements on the glacier surface or remotely of thickness, thickness change and surface velocity. The required data may be obtained 1 for thickness, from boreholes or radar; 2 for thickness change, from repeated optical surveying, laser altimetry, radar altimetry, photogrammetry, or Global Positioning System determinations of altitude; 3 for surface velocity, from repeated optical surveying or Global Positioning System determinations of stake locations or feature tracking. In the case of several repeated thickness change and velocity determinations, thickness can also be obtained as the solution of a problem in geophysical inverse theory.",
Freezing rain,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Rain that freezes upon impact, forming a surface coating of glaze, or after percolating below the glacier surface.",
Frontal ablation,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Loss of mass from a near-vertical glacier margin, such as a calving front. The processes of mass loss can include calving, subaerial melting and subaerial sublimation, and subaqueous frontal melting.",
Geodetic method,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Any method for determining mass balance by repeated mapping of glacier surface elevations to estimate the volume balance; cartographic method and topographic method are synonyms. The conversion of elevation change to mass balance requires information on the density of the mass lost or gained, or an assumption about the time variations in density (see Sorge's law). Elevation changes are commonly measured using repeated altimetry, photogrammetry or ground surveys. In the past, glacier mapping relied on ground surveying with theodolites and similar instruments, but global navigation satellite system receivers are now usual, offering more rapid and more accurate coverage. The entire glacier surface may be mapped, but more sparse elevation measurements, for example along a central flowline, are often extrapolated to the full glacier surface.",
Glacier fluctuations,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Glacier changes with time, such as changes of length, area, thickness, volume and mass.",
Glaciological method,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A method of determining mass balance in-situ on the glacier surface by measurements of accumulation and ablation, generally including measurements at stakes and in snow pits; direct method has long been a synonym. The measurements may also rely on depth probing and density sampling of the snow and firn, and coring. They are made at single points, the results from a number of points being extrapolated and integrated to yield the surface mass balance over a larger area such as an elevation band or the entire glacier. The internal mass balance and basal mass balance, and ice discharge if any, are treated separately.",
Gravimetric method,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A technique in which glacier mass variations are calculated from direct measurements of Earth's gravity field. Satellite gravimetry is at present the most feasible method for determining glacier mass balance from changes in gravity. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) consists of two polar-orbiting satellites separated by about 200 km along-track, and is the primary mission for this work to date. Precise measurements of range and range rate are used to construct local gravity fields after correcting for non-gravitational accelerations. Suitable models are used to remove gravity variations resulting from atmospheric, hydrospheric and lithospheric mass variations, leaving a time series that represents the glacier mass balance (usually summed and shown as the cumulative mass balance). GRACE spatial and temporal resolutions as good as 2 arc degrees and 10 days have been achieved. Satellite gravimetry is limited by the quality of observations used to constrain the models of non-glacial mass variations, and at present it can resolve only large and rapidly changing glacier complexes or glacierized regions. A distinctive advantage of the method is that it yields a direct measure of mass and does not require density corrections such as those required for geodetic methods. Glacier mass balance has also been estimated using ground-based gravimeters. Measurements at two or more times yield the change in absolute gravity that results from the change in vertical position of a sensor on the glacier surface or at a fixed position above it, and from changes in glacier mass. This technique may become more widely developed as gravimeter resolution, precision and portability improve.",
Growth time,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,The time scale for a glacier to attain steady state from an initial state of zero mass. See response time.,
Hydrological year,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A period of one year, synchronized with the natural progression of the hydrological seasons by specifying the calendar date of its first day. Generally in glaciology the hydrological year is found to be convenient because it begins near the start of the accumulation season and ends near the end of the ablation season. For example the appropriate dates are 1 October to 30 September in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The concept of the hydrological year is most useful where the accumulation and ablation seasons are well differentiated, as on mid-latitude glaciers and most high-latitude glaciers, but it is less well suited to those regions in which there are more than two hydrological seasons, as in the tropics, or in which most of the accumulation occurs in the same season as most of the ablation, as in monsoon climates (see summer-accumulation type.).",
Ice avalanche,SwissEdu,Ice general,A mass of ice which has detached itself from a steep glacier and which is descending on to the terrain below.,
Kinematic method,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Any method of determining the mass balance that involves measurement or calculation of glacier flow, including the flux-divergence method, the kinematic-equation method and methods in which the mass balance is determined as the sum of the discharge through a cross section and the surface mass balance of the region upglacier from the cross section. Information about density is needed to convert the volumetric fluxes obtained by kinematic methods to mass fluxes.",
Mass balance,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,The difference between accumulation and ablation on a glacier; usually calculated on an annual basis.,
"mass balance, Annual ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"The sum of accumulation and ablation over the mass-balance year, equivalent to the sum of Annual accumulation and Annual ablation, and also to the sum of winter mass balance and summer mass balance where winter and summer are well-differentiated; that is, ba = ca + aa = bw + bs. For reasons explained more fully under Net mass balance, the term Annual mass balance replaces the formerly distinct terms 'Annual balance' and 'net balance', which were used in the fixed-date system and the stratigraphic system respectively. The adjective 'Annual' describes the time span of the mass-balance measurement more adequately than the adjective 'net', which does not refer to a time period but rather to the mass that is remaining after all deductions (here ablation) have been made.",
"mass balance, Climatic ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The sum of the surface mass balance and the internal mass balance; see also climatic-basal mass balance. The term is introduced to preserve the distinction between its two components, which is compromised if surface mass balance is redefined to include internal accumulation. The qualifier 'climatic' reflects the fact that the surface and internal balances both depend strongly on interaction between the glacier, the hydrosphere and the atmosphere.",
"mass balance, Climatic-basal ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The sum of the climatic mass balance and the basal mass balance. The expression b csfc asfc ci ai cb ab states that the climatic-basal mass balance b is the sum of surface accumulation csfc, surface ablation asfc, internal accumulation ci, internal ablation ai, basal accumulation cb and basal ablation ab. The sum of cb and ab is the basal mass balance. The sum of ci and ai is the internal mass balance. The sum of csfc and asfc is the surface mass balance. The sum of the surface mass balance and internal mass balance (the first four quantities on the right of the expression) is the climatic mass balance. The sum of the six quantities on the right (that is, of the climatic mass balance and the basal mass balance) is the climatic-basal mass balance. The climatic-basal mass balance includes all those components of mass change that do not arise from glacier flow or frontal ablation. The qualifier 'basal' does not exclude a role for the climate, for example through interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean.",
"mass balance, Internal ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The change in the mass of the glacier due to internal accumulation and internal ablation over a stated period. See mass-balance units, climatic mass balance.",
"mass balance, Net ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"According to Anonymous (1969), the sum of accumulation and ablation over the mass-balance year in the stratigraphic system. In common usage, 'net balance' has a number of meanings inconsistent with that of Anonymous (1969; Appendix A). It is used for the balance over approximately one year, regardless of the time system (see fixed-date system, floating-date system), and for balances over other periods than the mass-balance year. In these usages 'net' has its plain-language meaning, referring to the change of mass after all deductions (here ablation) have been made. To resolve this ambiguity, it is recommended that the original definition of 'net mass balance' be retired, and that i) Annual mass balance be used instead for the mass balance over a mass-balance year in any time system; and ii) explicit information about the time system be given as metadata whenever it is relevant (as it is for all measurements by the glaciological method). The adjective 'net' thus becomes a plain-language word, and in many cases becomes redundant because the meaning of 'balance' includes the meaning of 'net'.",
"mass balance, Point ",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"Mass balance at a particular location on the glacier, for example at an ablation stake or a snow pit. The point referred to is at the top of a vertical column through the glacier. Most measurements of point mass balance are actually measurements of surface mass balance. That is, they exclude the internal mass balance and basal mass balance, which are either assumed to be negligible or corrected for later, and the flux divergence of the column. In the absence of an overriding reason for a different notation, point balances are indicated by lower-case letters, for example bw for the winter balance, while glacier-wide balances are denoted by upper-case letters, for example Bw.",
"mass balance, Specific ",IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"Mass balance expressed per unit area, that is, with dimension [M L-2] or [M L-2 T-1]; see specific. The prefix 'specific' is not necessary in general. The units in which a quantity is reported make clear whether or not it is specific. Specific mass balance may be reported for a point on the surface, a column of unit cross-section, or a larger volume such as an entire glacier or a collection of glaciers. In the latter two cases the term 'mean specific mass balance' has been used, although the adjective 'mean' is also not necessary. The definition of 'specific' apparently offered by Meier (1962) has led to some confusion. He wrote... Quantities measured at a point will first be discussed. [They] should all be prefaced by the word specific ...Specific budget terms have dimensions of [length] or [length]/[time]. The confusion arises because of the primacy given by Meier to water-equivalent dimensions ('[length]'). The adjective 'specific' indicates that the quantity has dimension [M L-2] or [M L-2 T-1], not that it is being measured at a point. The adjective 'point', as in point mass balance, should be used when clarity is needed. The unit of area lies in the horizontal plane, not a plane parallel to the glacier surface. For mass-balance purposes this rule applies even when the surface is vertical. For example, at a calving front the frontal ablation is equal to the mass of the entire volume lost by calving, melting and sublimation. If quoted as a specific quantity it is divided by the horizontal area over which the balance is to be stated, such as that of the entire glacier for a glacier-wide mass balance. The glaciological usage is not that which prevails in some other sciences, where often a specific quantity is either a dimensionless ratio of the value of a property of a given substance to the value of the same property of some reference substance, or is a quantity expressed per unit mass.",
"mass balance, Surface ",IACS-UNESCO,Ice general,"The sum of surface accumulation and surface ablation. This is the sense in which the term is understood in descriptions of measurements by the glaciological method, in which the internal mass balance is treated separately. Recently, in estimates of ice-sheet mass balance by modelling, the term has been extended to include internal accumulation. This extended meaning is discouraged. The unambiguous term climatic mass balance is recommended for the sum of the surface mass balance and the internal mass balance.",
"mass balance, Total ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"The sum of the climatic-basal mass balance and frontal ablation, or equivalently the sum of accumulation and ablation; a synonym of mass balance. The adjective 'total' was formerly a technical term in the stratigraphic system (Anonymous 1969; Appendix: A). It is now needed only when it is important to emphasize that all the components of the mass balance are being studied.",
"mass balance, Winter ",IACS-UNESCO,Misc,The sum of accumulation and ablation over the winter season.,
Mass budget,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"A synonym of mass balance. Mass budget is a more correct term than mass balance, but is used less often. While water balance and energy balance refer to equations in which the change in storage is only one of the terms, common glaciological usage equates mass balance with the change in storage (in other words, with the mass imbalance). It is unlikely that this usage will change.",
Mass flux,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"1 The horizontal rate of flow of mass through a plane normal to the direction of the horizontal velocity vector. Depending on the context, the flux may be through an element of area at a given position in the vertical plane, through a unit of width extending from the glacier bed to the surface, or through an entire glacier cross section. 2 The vertical rate of flow of mass at the glacier surface or bed. In sense 2, the flux at the surface is equal to the sum of surface accumulation and surface ablation, or in other words to the surface mass balance. Equivalently the flux at the bed is equal to the basal mass balance.",
Mass turnover,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The renewal of the mass of a glacier by mass-balance processes. Mass turnover is measured most usefully by the mass-turnover time, which is the mass of the glacier divided by the mass-balance amplitude, with the latter expressed as an Annual rate. Mass-turnover times range from several decades for glacierets to tens of thousands of years for ice sheets. See response time.",
Mass-balance amplitude,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"One half of the difference between winter mass balance and summer mass balance, (Bw  Bs)/2. Summer mass balance is generally negative because ablation dominates in the summer season. A more general definition, (Ca  Aa)/2 or one half of the Annual exchange, could be offered in terms of Annual accumulation and Annual ablation, but these quantities are so seldom measured that a calculation from seasonal balances is more practicable. The balance amplitude tends to be large in maritime climates, in which accumulation is large, and small in continental climates, in which accumulation is small. In consequence the mean balance amplitude is well correlated with the interannual variability of Annual mass balance, and, when it can be estimated from climatological information, has been used as an estimator of the magnitude of the Annual mass balance itself.",
Mass-balance gradient,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"The rate of change of mass balance with altitude, that is, the derivative db/dz of the mass-balance profile b (z). If mass balance varies linearly with altitude, the mass-balance gradient will be constant with z; if not, the gradient will vary with z. The mass-balance gradient at the equilibrium-line altitude is called the activity index.",
Mass-balance index,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,The rate of change db/dx of mass balance with horizontal distance from the upper end of a flowline. The term has also been used informally for a variety of measures of the mass balance.64,
Mass-balance profile,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,The variation b (z) of mass balance with altitude.,
Mass-balance rate,IACS-UNESCO,Ice general,"The change of mass per unit of time as the interval of mass change approaches zero, obtained in practice by dividing the mass balance by the duration over which it is measured or modelled. See mass-balance units. The qualifiers 'instantaneous' and 'average' can be used to distinguish between the rate in the mathematical sense and the rate as obtained in practice. For example, the average mass-balance rate",
Mass-balance ratio,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"The ratio of the mass-balance gradient in the ablation zone to the mass-balance gradient in the accumulation zone, each of these gradients being assumed constant and that in the accumulation zone also being assumed non-zero.",
Mass-balance sensitivity,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The change in mass balance due to a change in a climatic variable such as air temperature or precipitation. Sensitivities to temperature and precipitation are often expressed as changes in response to a 1 K warming or a 10% precipitation increase, resulting in a negative sensitivity to temperature and a positive sensitivity to precipitation. Sensitivities are generally derived from mass-balance modelling, that is, from the difference in mass balance between model runs with and without climate perturbation, but they have also been estimated from mass-balance and climate observations. Mass balance does not vary linearly with the climate in general. That is, d: B/d: T and d: B/d: P are not constant, but they may be assumed constant as a good approximation for small changes of the climatic variable. The 'dynamic' mass-balance sensitivity changes as the extent and area-altitude distribution of the glacier or glacierized region evolve. In contrast, the 'static' sensitivity neglects these geometric changes, although it may still vary with, for example, components of the surface energy balance.",
Mass-balance units,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The dimension of mass balance is [M] (mass). The dimension of the mass-balance rate is [M T-1] (mass per unit time). When the mass balance is presented per unit area, it is called specific mass balance and its dimension becomes [M L-2], while the dimension of the mass-balance rate becomes [M L-2 T-1]. When water-equivalent units are adopted (see below), the dimension becomes [L3] or [L3T-1], the corresponding specific units being [L] or [L T-1]. The unit for expressing mass or change of mass numerically is the kilogram (kg). When more convenient the petagram (Pg) or gigatonne (Gt; 1 Gt = 1 Pg = 1012 kg) can be substituted. When mass balance is expressed per unit area, its unit is kg m-2. The unit kg m-2 is usually replaced by the millimetre water equivalent, mm w. E. This substitution is convenient because 1 kg of liquid water, of density 1000 kg m-3, has a vertical extent of exactly 1 mm when distributed uniformly over a horizontal area of 1 m2. The units kg m-2 and mm w. E. Are therefore numerically identical. More formally, the metre water equivalent (m w. E.) Is an extension of the SI that is obtained by dividing a particular mass per unit area by the density of water, w: 1 m w. E. = 1000 kg m-2 / w: Because of the risk of confusion with the metre ice equivalent, or with ordinary lengths, it is important that the qualifier 'w. E.' Not be omitted. Mass balances can also be stated in m3 w. E. (1 m3 w. E. = 1 m w. E. Distributed uniformly over 1 m2) or km3 w. E. Note that 1 km3 w. E. Is numerically identical with 1 Gt. For the mass-balance rate, appropriate units are kg a-1 or kg m-2 a-1 (or m3 w. E. A-1 or mm w. E. A-1) when the time span is an integer multiple of 1 year. Over shorter intervals the unit of time should be the second or the day. Mass units (kg or m3 w. E.) Are useful for hydrological and oceanographic purposes, while specific mass units (kg m-2, mm w. E., m w. E.) Are needed when comparing the mass balances of different glaciers and for studying glacier-climate relations. To convert, with sufficient accuracy for many purposes, to the frequently needed sea-level equivalent (SLE), mass balance in kg m-2 is first converted to kg by multiplying by the area of the glacier, and then divided by the product of w and the area of the ocean (362.5  1012 m2). The sign of SLE is opposite to that of glacier mass balance, a loss from the ice being deemed to be an equivalent gain for the ocean.",
Mass-balance year,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The time span, equal or approximately equal in duration to one calendar year, to which the Annual mass balance in any time system refers. In the stratigraphic system the Annual mass balance is the change of mass during the period between formation of two successive minima in the sequence of Annual cycles of mass growth and decline. These minima are usually reached at different times in successive years, and the duration of the mass-balance year may therefore vary irregularly and substantially in duration from year to year. Point mass balances can be determined unambiguously in the stratigraphic system, but glacier-wide determinations require the assumption that the diachronous character of the summer surface can be neglected. In the fixed-date system the first day of the mass-balance year is always on the same calendar date, which is typically chosen to coincide with the start of the local hydrological year, for example 1 October in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere or 1 April in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, or sometimes with the average date of minimum Annual mass. The mass-balance year is 365 (or 366) days long. In the floating-date system the mass-balance year is defined by the calendar dates of the two successive surveys, which may vary from year to year and may or may not be 365 (or 366) days apart.",
Orographic snowline,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,The imaginary line formed by the generalized lower limit of perennial snowpatches on the terrain surface between glaciers at the end of the ablation season. The orographic snowline is so called (originally by Ratzel in 1886) because its altitude is predominantly defined by local topography and exposure.,
Quiescent phase,SwissEdu,Misc,The period in which a surge-type glacier is slow-moving or stagnant. This period is typically decades long in contrast to the surge phase that may last only a few months or years.,
Reaction time,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The time required for a change in forcing of mass balance to result in an observable response of the geometry, particularly the length, of the glacier. The reaction time is not a physical property of the glacier. Estimates of the reaction time depend on, among other things, the precision of observation and the extent to which the glacier is out of equilibrium. See response time.",
recession,SwissEdu,Glaciers,"The shrinking of the snout (toe) of a glacier following successive years of negative mass balance (q.v.). This is usually evident from the recession of the ice margin on land, or calving in the sea, but also from down-wasting. Also referred to by the term glacier retreat.",
Response time,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The e-folding time scale for the transition of a glacier, following a step change in mass balance, from one steady state to another. Response times have been formulated for various attributes of the glacier such as volume and length. They can be confused easily with the mass-turnover time; the reaction time; and the growth time. The volumetric response time is the most commonly seen formulation. Here the glacier changes from an initial volume V1 to a later volume V2, and the response time is the time needed for the volume to change by (V2  V1) (1  e-1), where e = 2.71828... Is the base of natural logarithms. The response time is much shorter than the time required to attain volume V2. Indeed, in this formulation the time to attain volume V2 is infinite. The change between state 1 and state 2 is assumed to be 'small'. The response time for volume is somewhat shorter than that for length, that is, for the length to change by (L2  L1) (1  e-1). The response time is an idealization. The essence of the idea is that the glacier 'remembers' its earlier steady state because it adjusts its size and shape by flow. The volume response time is often estimated with an expression due to J",
Retreat,1-NSIDC,Glaciers,When a mountain glacier's terminus doesn't extend as far downvalley as it previously did; occurs when ablation surpasses accumulation.,
Snow accumulation,AMS,Snow,"A measurement of the depth of snow on the ground made either since the snow began falling or since a previous observation. (also called snow depth.)   The total accumulation is equivalent to the total snow depth during a storm, or after any single snowstorm or series of storms. Snow accumulation can vary due to settling and melting and will therefore vary depending on how often it is measured. For example, if new snow is measured every hour during a relatively long duration storm, it is likely that the summed accumulations may exceed a total snow accumulation measured only once at the end of the storm.",
Snow accumulation and ablation model,NOAA Hydro,Snow,"A model which simulates snow pack accumulation, heat exchange at the air-snow interface, areal extent of snow cover, heat storage within the snow pack, liquid water retention, and transmission and heat exchange at the ground-snow interface.",
Snowline,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A set of points forming the lower limit of a snow-covered area; on a glacier, the line separating snow surfaces from ice or firn surfaces, and also separating the percolation zone from either the superimposed ice zone or the ablation zone (see also zone). The set of points need not form a continuous curve. The snow-covered area of the glacier may include outliers (isolated patches of snow surrounded by firn or ice) and may exclude inliers (isolated patches of exposed firn or ice). The snowline is usually easy to see, because the snow above it is brighter than the firn or ice below it. It may therefore be mapped by analysis of suitable imagery. When, and only when, there is no superimposed ice, the snowline coincides with the equilibrium line. Unless qualified by a different adjective, references to the snowline are understood to refer to the Annual snowline. It is common for 'snowline' to be used as an abbreviation of 'average altitude of the snowline'.",
"snowline, Annual ",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The snowline at the end of the ablation season, usually representing the highest position of the snowline during the mass-balance year; end-of-summer snowline is a synonym. The snowline of any given balance year is established at the end of that balance year. If this newly established snowline is lower than the previous year's firn line, it also becomes the new firn line.",
"snowline, End-of-summer ",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,A synonym of Annual snowline.,
"snowline, Regional",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,See article Regional snowline under Snowline.,
"snowline, Transient ",IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The snowline at any instant, particularly during the ablation season.",
Steady state,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A state of the glacier in which over many years the thickness at the end of each mass-balance year remains unchanged, that is, dh/dt = 0 at every point; see equilibrium, Balanced-budget. It follows from the definition that the glacier-wide mass balance, including frontal ablation, is zero, because the glacier must flow at just the rate required to eliminate thickness changes due to the climatic-basal mass balance. Steady state is a valuable idealization, and may be realized roughly when the climate is constant, or changes only slowly, over periods considerably longer than the response time of the glacier.",
Summer season,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The time span from the end of the winter season to the end of the mass-balance year. The length of the summer season may vary greatly from year to year. The term is best suited to glaciers of winter-accumulation type. In the stratigraphic system the summer season starts when the glacier has attained maximum mass and ends when the glacier has attained minimum mass. In the floating-date system and the fixed-date system, the mass is not necessarily at its Annual maximum or minimum when the summer season starts or ends.",
Summer surface,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The surface formed at the time of minimum Annual mass at each point on the glacier, marking (in the stratigraphic system) the end of one mass-balance year and the start of the next. In general the summer surface is diachronous. For example, when the higher reaches of a glacier start to gain mass, the lower parts may still be ablating. The summer surface is the surface on which the first snow of the new balance year falls. It is easily detectable when it consists of glacier ice, which now includes superimposed ice added during the previous balance year. In the firn area it is recognizable as a well-marked crust, that is, a thin, relatively strong layer with a density near that of ice, and sometimes also (or instead) as a layer of depth hoar at the base of the current year's accumulation. The crust typically originates by recrystallization of the surface snow in late summer to form glaze. It may also be marked by an accumulation of sediment or wind-blown dust. It can be difficult to detect when melting and snowfall alternate during the transition between the ablation season and the accumulation season. In some mass-balance programmes the summer surface is 'labelled' in the vicinity of stakes with a distinctive material, such as sawdust, during a visit late in the ablation season.",
Temperature-index model,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"A model of mass balance in which surface ablation is estimated as a function of temperature, usually near-surface air temperature measured either on the glacier or at the nearest weather station; temperatures may also be taken from upper-air soundings, meteorological reanalyses or climate models. A leading form of temperature-index model is the positive degree-day model, in which a degree-day factor represents the dependence of ablation on temperature. Temperature-index models are valuable because they require only simple input variables and perform well when suitably calibrated, for example by allowing for the differences in reflectivity between surfaces of ice and snow by choosing a smaller degree-day factor for snow than for ice.",
Terrestrial calving ,GLIMS Manual,Glaciers,"Dry calving; Ice front breaks off over cliffs or rock steps of different height; This class has been introduced to facilitate a differentiation between calving into water (lakes, sea) and dry calving. ",
Thinning flux,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The mass flux through a vertical cross section corresponding to the decrease of mass upglacier from the section (that is, the integral of density over the thickness of the glacier and the upglacier area).",
Time system,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A protocol for identifying stages in the evolution of the mass balance of the glacier over the mass-balance year, making it possible to quantify the mass change during each stage objectively. Four time systems are recognized. Figure 14 illustrates the differences between the original two.",
Topographic method,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"Like cartographic method, a synonym of geodetic method in the context of measurement of mass balance.",
Total exchange,IACS-UNESCO,Misc,"A term formerly used (Anonymous1969; Appendix: A) for the difference between Annual accumulation and Annual ablation, ca minus aa, in the stratigraphic system. Note that ablation is defined to be negative.",
Volume balance,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The change in the volume of a glacier, or part of a glacier, over a stated span of time. A volume balance contains no information about the density of the matter within the volume gained or lost. It is meaningful in itself, but is often an intermediate product in the determination of mass balance by geodetic methods. Balances expressed in ice-equivalent or water-equivalent units, such as m3 w. E. A-1, are not volume balances but mass balances.",
Volumetric calving flux,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,The calving flux divided by average glacier density (dimension [L3 T-1]).,
Wet-snow line,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The set of points on a glacier separating the upper percolation zone, at higher elevation, from the lower percolation zone or wet-snow zone. The wet-snow line has no surface expression, but is significant as the upper limit of the region where internal accumulation may happen.",
Wet-snow zone,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,The part of the accumulation zone of a cold glacier or polythermal glacier where all of the snow reaches the melting point during the ablation season. The wet-snow zone is sometimes referred to as the lower percolation zone.,
Wind ablation mass loss by wind scour,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"Snow lost to wind ablation on one part of the glacier surface is often re-deposited in more sheltered parts of the glacier surface, making no contribution to glacier-wide ablation.",
Wind scour,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"The entrainment and removal of surface snow by the wind. The resulting windborne snow may be re-deposited elsewhere in more sheltered parts of the glacier surface, or may be transported off the glacier.",
Windborne snow,IACS-UNESCO,Snow,"Blowing snow or drifting snow. Windborne snow may be redistributed from one part of the glacier to another. It contributes to the glacier-wide mass balance only when it is carried across a lateral boundary of the glacier, either inward or outward, or when it suffers sublimation instead of being redeposited.",
Winter season,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"The time span from the start of the mass-balance year to the time of maximum glacier mass. The term is best suited to glaciers of winter-accumulation type. In the stratigraphic system the winter season ends when the glacier has attained maximum mass. In the floating-date system and the fixed-date system, the mass is not necessarily at its Annual minimum or maximum when the winter season starts or ends.",
Zone,IACS-UNESCO,Glaciers,"A part of the glacier, and especially of the glacier surface, distinguished from other parts by the prominence or predominance of a particular mass-balance process. The temperate glacier of Figure 15 and the cold glacier of Figure 16 are end members of a continuum. Many glaciers have attributes, including patterns of zonation, that are intermediate between these end members. The conventional system of zones in the English-language literature diverges in part from that in Russian-language work (Shumskiy 1955). For the latter, which is based on the relative magnitudes of accumulation, melting and cold content.",
