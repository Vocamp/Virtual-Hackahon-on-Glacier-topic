# Virtual-Hackahon-on-Glacier-topic
This will be a virtual session with people collaborating for part of their day on a common vocabulary/ontology for glaciers and related concepts.

The main objective is to align the base semantics around a set of glacier-related terms. These will then be encoded in existing projects, aligning them to the collaborative outcomes of this hackathon.

## Working documents

We'll collect all working documents in a Google drive folder ([here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XjRQdI-ndNHMk_nGINo5yoCU5WM99TEl)) to ease collaborative editing. These will be consolidated in this repo once they're stable. 
- [The set of 33 terms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Nm1vj2hM7a3Gewkqkrnkn0zSTGOQK5JH0tGj8PNIU8/edit#gid=32243948) on which the hackathon will be focused.
- [An intial mind map](https://www.draw.io/#G1_2ybICAzjOjYlgf-93Xme5DfdgYaRsJ6) put forth by @Garybc and encoded in draw.io by @kaiiam. This map overlaps with the 33 terms above, but has some other content too.
- [A document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TF20sW2crq45cIb0pe1Nyx-6DcjlfQx5oFg4sAyj3wM/edit) to keep track of how this hackathon has changed/aligned your project to others
- [A minutes doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcVHJdFfdO4QdkcHNx4eBt9-W3A2DC4i-8RW0Zxr0XA/edit) to keep track of who's doing what and why
